## nd608 - Project: Personalized Real Estate Agent

### Introduction

This is repo contains my implementation for Udacity's Generative AI Nanodregree "Project: Personalized Real Estate Agent.

The code uses [`python-dotenv`](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) to load an `.env` file (not provided) from the same directory to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` value environment variable. If this library is not available within Udacity's workspace, the client's `api_key` parameter will have to be set manually.
